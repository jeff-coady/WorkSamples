# WorkSamples

This repository includes samples of my own work. I'm starting with analyses related to my Capstone project. I was working on a project examining language outcomes in deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) children. Colorado instituted universal newborn hearing screening in 1997 in order to identify children with hearing loss earlier so that remediation could begin before these children start to lag behind their peers. The problem is that nobody had ever shown that the program does what it's supposed to. So this project was meant to show that DHH children's language abilities have been and are improving as a result of newborn hearing screening.

The first file is the machine learning model from my Capstone project. The second is a follow-up linear regression on the same data. The third is a visualization to directly demonstrate that newborn hearing screening works.

My plan is to add more work samples over time, demonstrating different methods.
